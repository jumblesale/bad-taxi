# bad-taxi ðŸš•

Welcome to the `bad-taxi` kata.

This kata was developed for the TWNLðŸŒ·
Coding Dojo to practice the red, green,
refactor cycle.

If you aren't here from
the dojo, perhaps you will also
find it interesting!

## Structure

- The [bad_taxi](bad_taxi) directory contains
  a reference solution for the exercise.
- [bad_taxi.ipynb](bad_taxi.ipynb) is a Google
  colab notebook where you can work through
  the exercise interactively

## Thanks

None of this would have happened without
the phenomenal support of my friends and
colleagues at TWNL. Particular thanks to:

- Will Ensoll
- Alessandro Pagliero
- Monica Calderero Rey
- Alyona Galyeva

You're wonderful! ðŸ’•
